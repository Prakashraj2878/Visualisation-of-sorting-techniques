The sorting visualization project is an interactive web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to visually understand and compare various sorting algorithms by displaying how they operate on a dataset in real-time. The project features a dynamic interface where users can choose from different sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Selection sort, insertion sort,and Merge Sort. Users can also control the speed of the visualization and the size of the dataset. The application uses animations to illustrate the sorting process, making it easier for users to grasp the underlying mechanics of each algorithm.
